The French Press brew method is one of the easiest brew methods to execute and master. It's a simple process of beans, grind, water to coffee ratio, and time. Full immersion is the unique character at play here and is what sets this method apart from other methods. In this post, I share my process and exact recipe — end to end.

The key to a good French Press brew is to know your dose ratio. I like to use a 16:1 ratio. That's 16 parts beans to 1 part water. For example, I weigh out 20 grams of beans and grind them to a coarse grind, then pour 320 grams of water. With the French Press you're going to get a more full bodied brew which will likely include a bit of sedement in the bottom of your cup. The mesh filter of the press does a great job of seperating grinds from coffee on plunge, but the reason folks reach for this method if for its ease of brew first, and its taste second.

I'm also a fan of doing a 30-45 second bloom before the full immersion pour to brew. Once the bloom is complete I slowly pour the remaining water amount and sit back and wait for the brew to complete.

Below are my full instructions as well as suggested gear and beans.

## The Recipe

Produces a single serving, 300 gram yeild. Double or triple if you're brewing more than a single serving.

- Weigh out 20 grams of good coffee.
- Prepare your coffee as a medium grind and set aside.
- Heat a batch of water to 200 degrees F.
- Place the French Press on your scale and tare it out to zero.
- Add your ground coffee and double check that your weight is accurate to 20 grams, then tare it out to zero once more before you pour.
- Give the press a subtle shake to even out the coffee grounds.
- Begin to slowly pour around 30-50 grams of water to saturate the grounds and start the bloom.
- After 30-45 seconds beging to slowly pour until you've reached 320 grams on the scale.
- Step aside and let time take care of the rest — approximatley 4 minute brew time should work
- Discard that water in your cup
- Discard the filter in the Chemex and pour your coffee into your cup.
- Enjoy it black, or add other ingredients to make it your own.
