The French Press brew method is one of the easiest brew methods to execute and master. It's a simple process of the right beans with a coarse grind, water to coffee ratio and time. Full immersion is the unique characteristic for brewing with a French Press and is what sets this method apart from all the other methods. In this post, I share my process and the exact recipe I use — end to end.

## Good French Press coffee

The key to good French Press coffee is the perfect ratio of water to coffee.

My methed is uses a 16:1 ratio of beans to coffee. That's 16 parts beans to 1 parts water.

Start by weighing out 20 grams of beans, then grind them to a coarse grind. Then, heat a pot of water to 204 degrees (f). Pour 40 grams of water to start the brew process. This is known as blooming the coffee. Bloom for 30-45 seconds bloom before the full immersion pour to brew. Once the bloom is complete, slowly pour 280 grams of water, then gently stir for 30 seconds. Sit back and wait for 3 minutes and 30 seconds for the brew to complete. End-to-end the brew process should be around 4 minutes and 30 seconds.

## What to expect

With the French Press brew method you're going to get a more full bodied brew of coffee which will likely include a bit of sedement in the bottom of your cup. The mesh filter of the press does a great job of seperating grinds from coffee on plunge, but the reason folks reach for this method if for the simplicity of the brew method and the more full bodied taste.

Below are my full instructions as well as suggested gear and beans.

- Heat a batch of water to 200 degrees F.
- Place the French Press on your scale and tare it out to zero.
- Add your ground coffee and double check that your weight is accurate to 20 grams, then tare it out to zero once more before you pour.
- Give the press a subtle shake to even out the coffee grounds.
- Begin to slowly pour around 30-50 grams of water to saturate the grounds and start the bloom.
- After 30-45 seconds beging to slowly pour until you've reached 320 grams on the scale.
- Step aside and let time take care of the rest — approximatley 4 minute brew time should work
