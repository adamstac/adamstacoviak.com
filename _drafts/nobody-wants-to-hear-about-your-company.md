But, **they will listen to your story**. Once you understand that the human mind is wired to pay attention to and retain stories, it can drastically increase the impact of how we're able to help you.

For example...

- Instead of creating a product overview style ad spot with all the features and benefits, we'd rather tell the product’s origin story. Tell how it came into existence, why you needed to create it and the struggle you went through to make it happen for your market.
- Instead of explaining how a feature works, we'd rather tell a story of how a customer implemented the feature to solve their problem. Bonus points if we can get them involved. Our audience wants to hear from their peers about the challenges they face and solutions they implented to overcome those challenges.
- Instead of talking about your company and how great you are, we'd rather tell stories about your best customer’s progress, especially if you help them move the ball forward in meaningful ways.
- Instead of promoting "that new thing" and \how to buy it, we'd rather connect with the team in charge of shipping it get a behind the scenes look at why you built it in the first place.

Story is more engaging and allows you to transition away from boring, fact-based marketing.

It's simple. **Facts tell. Stories sell.** The human brain is hard-wired to remember and share stories.

Story allows us to gain and hold attention. It lets us show the emotional components of what it looks like to work with you and while also providing a more consumable presentation of your facts.

Story is the natural human method to consume information and make decisions.

Once we start using this strategy to your advantage, you will see a greater return on your investment in content.
