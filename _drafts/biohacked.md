I used to think intermittent fasting was about starving yourself. It's not. Intermittent fasting is about understanding what hunger really is and controling when you eat so you can regain control of your life.

Everything you know about fasting is probably wrong. In this post I'll share with you what I've learned about intermittent fasting and hopefully change your mind.

**So what exactly is intermittent fasting and why is it good for you?**

Fasting is different from starving in one important way. Control. Fasting is voluntary. Starving is not. They’re on opposite sides of the spectrum. With fasting you are in control of when you start and when you stop.

Everyone fasts everyday, technically. When you’re not eating you’re fasting. Consider breakfast. You’re breaking your fast, usually after 8 hours or more of sleep. In this case you’ll have been fasting for 8 hours or more before your next meal.

Fasting has been practiced for centuries for various reasons. The reasons that matter most are the connections of fasting to health benefits, specifically anti-aging, weight lost, and the prevention and/or the reversal of Type II Diabetes, Insulin Resistance, PCOS, and more.

The other hidden benefit to fasting is efficiency — efficiency of time and money. If you only eat once or twice a day, that’s a lot time and money being saved.

Fasting is bad for some though. The food industry. They lose money when you’re in greater control of what, when, and how much you eat. It's in their best interest for them to make you think you need to eat more often, drink sodas, not skip meals, or even have a snack between meals. They want you to believe if you don’t eat 3 meals a day, have an Apple for a snack, a candy bar because it’s right there at the counter or whatever their advertising and marketing says, then you’ll somehow be missing out on some due satisfaction. After all, “Snickers satisfies.”

Those who practice intermittent fasting do it as a lifestlye choice of efficiency, to reverse aging, and often to lose weight. At its basic form, intermittent fasting is about eating within a specific time period, and then fast the rest of the time. (Why do this? Try to answer this someday...)

The Keto diet and intermittent fasting tend to go hand in hand because they complment eachother very well. Fasting is quite hard to do if you consume a high amount of sugar in your diet. Sugar tends to keep you hungry while high fat diets like the Ketogenic diet lead to feeling full with less cravings for food.

When it comes to efficiency, consider this true story.

I was traveling recently for work to Seattle. My flight was at 11:45am with a boarding time of 11:15am. I like to get to the airport at least one hour before my boarding time. That means I needed to get to the airport by 9:45am to account for parking and getting to the terminal.

**Most people eat breakfast in morning. I don't. I start my day with a bulletproof coffee which I make myself at home.** My brew method of choice that morning was based on its speed and efficiency. I chose the Chemex brew method which takes as long as it takes to grind the beans and the water to flow through the grinds into the decanter. It's a super fast, super effiencient brew method with an end to end brew time of 4-6 minutes from grind to pour.

Not only does that save me the money I'd spend on getting a coffee on the way. It also saves me the time I'd spend stopping at a coffee shop which can be hit or miss when it comes to crowds or long lines.

I'm not a big fan of feeling like I just stuffed my faced when flying, so even before I started to do intermittent fasting I would eat a very lite meal or snack before flying. Now I don't have to eat anything at all and I feel nice and empty, becuase I am.

Prior to IF I'd have to eat something, small or large so I wasn't starving on the plance and feeling anxious about getting a snack before take off or while flying Everyone has a method to how they travel and for me, I hate feeling stuffed or having to number 2 on a plane. I've done it once or twice in my life. It's really hard to do well if you're over-weight.

Because I practice intermittent fasting, I don't have to eat until my eating window, which isn't until 5-7pm. That gives me complete freedom while traveling to focus on traveling instead of having to stop and eat or snack. I was able to browse the bookstore before my flight and catch up on the latest bestsellers out there to consider reading.

Most people eat breakfast in morning. I don't. I fast everyday until 5pm when my eating window opens up until 7pm. That means I can go all day without the need to stop and eat. I just start my morning with a bulletproof coffee and I'm fueled up for the day.

Everyone has a method to how they travel and for me, I hate feeling stuffed or having to number 2 on a plane. I've done it once or twice in my life. It's really hard to do well if you're over-weight.

## I start my day with bulletproof coffee

In the AM I drink a bulletproof coffee. This is a style of coffee that's focused on a high dose of fat instead of sugar to fuel your brain and diet needs, esspecially those who Keto.

Here's the basic recipe for Bulletproof coffee:

- Around 12 ounces of your favorite black coffee (read this post to learn about my various favorite brew methods)
- 1 tbsp of Kerrygold salted or unsalted butter
- 1 tbsp of MCT oil
- 1 scoop of grass-fed Collagen Peptides

## I drink bone marrow broth for lunch

At around 1 or 1:30 I head to the kitchen to warm up 15 ounces of good bone marrow broth. I heat it up on the stove top in a small pot at a little under medium heat to slowly bring it to a good tempurture. Most times I add a little fresh ground peper and salt.

I have these awesome white porcelain 16 ounce coffee mugs that double as an excellent latte cup and bowl in one. Once the broth reaches a good temp I pour it into the mug.

My broth is often a lifesaver when it comes to maintaining my fast.

## Keto for dinner

For dinner me and my wife reach for one of the several Keto cookbooks for ideas and make a plan. Well, we really make our plans earlier in the week so we're set and in a groove, but you get the point. Read this post to learn how we prepare for the week.

## Books I've read on the subject

- The complete guide to fasting
- Essentialism
- The Obesity Code
- The blood sugar solution
- The blood sugar solution 10-day detox diet

## My story?

Three months ago I weighted in at 305 lbs on my doctors scale. I was tired all the time. I abrely had the energy to get through the day. Walking long distances was chore and I dreaded it.

## My Chemex brew method

- Weight out 25 grams of good coffee.
- Prepare your coffee as a medium grind and set aside.
- Heat two batches of water. One for rinsing the filter and the other for brewing the coffee.
- Put your filter into the Chemex (the three folds should be forward)
- Slowly pour the first batch of water over the entire filter to ensure you rinse all paper waste through the filter. I recommend you use a goose neck kettle to control your pour.
- Take this time to swirl that hot water to warm decanter, then discard into your cup to pre-warm your cup.
- Place the filter back in the Chemex and place your Chemex on a scale and tare it out to zero.
- Add your ground coffee and double check that your weight is accurate to 25 grams, then tare it out to zero once more before your pour.
- Give the Chemex a subtle shake to flatten out the coffee grounds.
- Add your "just off the boil" water to your goose neck kettle and get ready to pour.
- Begin to slowly pour a 70 gram pour over all the grounds to start the bloom.
- Let the water flow through and prepare to get your second pour on.
- Slowly pour with small circular motions in the center of the grounds and spiral out close to but not to the edge of the grounds.
- Continue to slowly pour with small circular motions until you see 425 grams on the scale.
- Step aside and let gravity do the rest (the water should flow through in about 2 minutes).
- Discard that water in your cup and rinse if you need to.
- Discard the filter in the Chemex and pour your coffee into your cup.
- Enjoy it black, or add other ingredients to make it your own.
