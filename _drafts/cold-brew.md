Cold brewed coffee is smooth and less acidic.

I've been brewing at a 9:1 ratio. That's 9 grams of water per 1 gram of coffee.

I grind my coffee at a french press grind. I use the [Baratza Encore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fY3wvQh4iao) at a grind setting of 30.

Brew for 14 hours then run it through a Chemex filter.

Enjoy.
