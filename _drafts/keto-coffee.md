This recipe calls for Ghee to remove the milk parts found in grass-fed butter. If you're not a fan of Ghee, you can substitute Kerrygold unsalted butter.

The Himalayan salt adds minerals often lacking in a Ketogenic diet. Also, salt subtly enhances the flavors in this recipe.

## Ingredients:

- MCT oil - 1 Tbsp
- Ghee - 1/2 Tbsp
- Cacao powder - 1 Tbsp
- Coffee - 12 oz
- Himalayan salt - 1/8 Tsp

## Instructions:

1. Start by making your favorite brew of coffee. You'll want to aim for 12oz to 15oz of tasty coffee.
2. In a Magic Bullet or Ninja blender, add the MCT oil, Ghee, Cacao powder, and Himalayan salt.
3. Add the coffee
4. Blend for 20 seconds
5. Pour and enjoy
