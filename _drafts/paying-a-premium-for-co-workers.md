After reading this article on The Walrus titled [Why It's so Hard to Actually Work in Shared Offices](https://thewalrus.ca/why-its-so-hard-to-actually-work-in-shared-offices/), I couldn't help but think about how the tables have shifted for today's workforce.

Back in the day, which doesn't seem all that long ago to me -- workers typically worked in an office or at a location where a businesses day to day operations were conducted. This is still true today, but it is also true that more and more people are either working as a freelancer, working from home for themselves or as a remote employee, or some other mix who don't have to go in to an office to get their work done.

Nicholas Hune-Brown, writes for The Walrus:

> [According to a survey](https://blog.freelancersunion.org/2016/10/06/freelancing-in-america-2016/) by Upwork and the Freelancers Union, more than one-third of workers in the United States were freelancers in 2016— some 55 million and counting. A study by accounting-software provider QuickBooks predicts that 45 percent of the Canadian workforce will be self-employed by 2020. WeWork is determined to become the default home for a new generation of white-collar workers. It believes that **these budding entrepreneurs have no interest in the grey cubicles of the past**.

In 2016, 35% of the workforce in America were freelancers and contributed $1 trillion dollars to the economy. That number is astonding.

## What is WeWork?

[WeWork has a $20 billion valuation](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenbertoni/2017/07/10/wework-hits-20-billion-valuation-in-new-funding-round/#3fdc54c71194). I pulled this from [their homepage](https://www.wework.com/):

> **Make a life, not just a living.** WeWork is a global network of workspaces where companies and people grow together. We transform buildings into dynamic environments for creativity, focus, and connection. More than just the best place to work, though, this is a movement toward humanizing work. We believe that CEOs can help each other, offices can use the comforts of home, and we can all look forward to Monday if we find real meaning in what we do.

I've never been to a WeWork workspace, but I have been to other co-working spaces like [WELD](http://www.weld.co/) and various places here in Houston. Most times I didn't go to be productive with day to day work. I went to be productive with networking and community. I went to see other people. I went to gain a  clearer definition of work/life balance and to get out of the house.

Like most freelancers, small team startups, or distributed workers -- we tend to work from home for the lifestyle it affords us. We don't have co-workers tough. And no, your 2 year old son, husband, wife, or your dog or cat aren't considered co-workers. As workers from home, we often work in complete isoloation. Most of us like it that way. But To get an often much needed interaction with other like-minded humans we go to places like Slack, Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, or LinkedIn, in hopes of finding connection, acceptance, and value.

The WeWork model offers the same, but in a face to face, localized, accessible package. They offer a real place, with real people.

Nicholas Hune-Brown, writes for The Walrus:

> Fotini Iconomopoulos, a negotiation consultant, perched on one of the many couches. She had spent years working on the road and from cafés before trying out a co-working space. “I like the idea of **seeing people** that I can connect with on a regular basis, seeing familiar faces,” she explained.

> Dane Jensen said, the building’s vibe could feel invigorating at times. “If I’ve been working at home for too many days in a row and I’m feeling sluggish, it’s nice to go somewhere where there’s a lot of **busy people being productive**.”

Both Fotini and Dane said they wanted to be with other people. They didn't say "where we can get things done." There's a difference. But, does it really matter you won't be "as productive" or "getting things done" while you're there? Probably not.

## Free co-workers

There was a time when co-workers came free with the job. Now we have to pay a premium to rent a desk, be a member, attend a conference -- and it's not even about getting more done. It's about connection.

Work is work, no matter how you slice it. If you're working on work stuff, you're working. Getting the work done, networking, connecting, pouring into others, having others pour into you, etc. --- they are all forms of the work you need to do to be the you you need to be to get the job done.

The WeWork's and WELD's of the world are certainly a step in the right direction of productivity from a coffee house that just so happens to be co-working friendly so they can sell more coffee and pastries.

But, are we just paying a premium for co-workers?
