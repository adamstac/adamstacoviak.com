If you don't show up, you can't find a place to belong.

Here's the thing about imposter syndrome -- when you're in the middle of a full blown imposter syndrome attack, you don't think you're being an imposter. It's just like any other day. It's business as usual.

...you just think you're not enough, or you don't belog, or you're not accepted. Being, or having, an imposter complex is the farthest thing from your mind.

But guest what?! That's exactly what imposter syndrome is.

Before you know it, you're talking to yourself in your head witht that condemning voice. You're telling yourself that something you've done, something you will do, couldn't do, shouldn't do, whatever -- isn't something you're capable of. You're better off just not going it. It didn't work out the last time, or the time before that. So why try?

You don't belong.

Everyone is going to laugh at you.

You're stupid and they're going to find out what you've know all along.

You have no clue what you're talking about.

You have _nothing_ to offer.

Any attempt to change any of the above will result in total ruin. People will finally discover you are an idiot.

You know what I did after all of this self-loathing and abuse?

**I didn't show up.**

Here's the thing. You can't not belong if you don't show up.

If you're not showing up...

For years, I attempted to do this blogging thing. A post here. A link post there. But nothing substantial. Well, there was that one profound thing I wrote about spending time, but I've since moved from that databased backed WordPress blog and now I have no clue where that post lives or why in the world I didn't bring it along for the ride across blogging platforms and databases.

If I find it in the future, I promise to post it here again.
