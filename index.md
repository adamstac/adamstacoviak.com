**Hello, I'm Adam Stacoviak.**

\-\-\-

I've been designing, developing, and leading products since 2006.

I started podcasting that same year as co-host of [The Web 2.0 Show](http://web20show.com/).

Now I'm the Founder and Editor-in-Chief of [Changelog.com](https://changelog.com/) where we publish news and podcasts for developers. We produce several well known podcasts, like:

- [The Changelog](https://changelog.com/podcast)
- [Founders Talk](https://changelog.com/founderstalk)
- [Go Time](https://changelog.com/gotime)

View the full lineup of podcasts we produce at [changelog.com/podcasts](https://changelog.com/podcasts).

Thousands upon thousands of developers visit our homepage, read our emails, and listen to our podcasts everyday to keep up. You should too.
