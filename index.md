**Hello, I'm Adam Stacoviak.**

\-\-\-

I've been designing, developing, and leading products since 2006.

I started podcasting that same year as co-host of [The Web 2.0 Show](http://web20show.com/).

Now I'm the Founder and Editor-in-Chief of [Changelog Media](https://changelog.com/) where we publish news and podcasts for developers. We produce several podcasts ~ [The Changelog](https://changelog.com/podcast), [Request For Commits](https://changelog.com/rfc), [Go Time](https://changelog.com/gotime), and [more](https://changelog.com/podcasts).

Thousands of developers visit our homepage everyday to keep up. If you're not [subscribed](https://changelog.com/weekly), trust me -- _you're missing out_.

\-\-\-

Where can you go from here?

- Read [blog posts]({{ site.url | absolute_url }}/blog) I've written
- Follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/adamstac), [GitHub](https://github.com/adamstac), or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adamstacoviak/)
- Join [Changelog's developer community](https://changelog.com/community)

Thanks!
