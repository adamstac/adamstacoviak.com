**Hello, I'm Adam Stacoviak.**

I've been designing, developing, and leading products since 2006.

That's right around the same time I started podcasting. http://web20show.com/

Now I'm the Founder and Editor-in-Chief of [Changelog Media](https://changelog.com/) where we publish news and podcasts for developers. We produce several podcasts ~ [The Changelog](https://changelog.com/podcast), [Request For Commits](https://changelog.com/rfc), [Go Time](https://changelog.com/gotime), and [more](https://changelog.com/podcasts).

More than 15,000 developers visit our homepage everyday to keep up. If you are not subscribed to [our weekly email](https://changelog.com/weekly), trust me when I say -- _you are missing out_.

Thanks!
