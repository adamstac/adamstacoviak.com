At Pure Charity, we've been working hard to build a global giving platform that inspires a movement of generosity to impact real lives and ultimately change the world. We've learned a lot over the past year about what we're building. We're very much still in beta, but it's certainly ready to use and fund projects. In fact, we already have [a funded project](https://www.purecharity.com/provide-a-life-changing-mintesanew-fikadu-clubfoot-surgery?aff=36437) that will provide our friend Fidaku with his much needed clubfoot surgery. Cool right?!





We have numerous moving parts we are working on, but I wanted to share this early access with you.





## Here's what you can do to help ...







  1. Watch [this video](https://vimeo.com/35318032) and [this video](https://vimeo.com/35279010) to get to know our mission


  2. We're invite only, so [create your account with this link](https://purecharity.com?aff=36437)


  3. Look around, discover projects. Follow projects, field partners and people. Back a project and see lives changed


  4. [Invite some friends](https://www.purecharity.com/invites/social?aff=36437) from Facebook, email or even copy your advocate URL from [this page](https://www.purecharity.com/invites/social?aff=36437) and send a personal email to friends


  5. Check out [Pure Charity Rewards](https://www.purecharity.com/rewards/featured?aff=36437) - there are lots of opportunities to buy what you already buy, but instead get money back to your Giving Fund so you can fund your favorite projects on Pure Charity


  6. Tell me your thoughts about what we've built and where we're at today
