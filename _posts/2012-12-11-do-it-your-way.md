Let's face it -- when you're doing it your own way, _it doesn't feel like work._

In [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIXx617xVMo&list=PLG7JvYPJw5oOH0Xbtfs_6BLjVE61fkPNa), Sarah Lacy asks AngelList Co-founder Naval Ravikant about the one thing he believes in that no one else does.

Sarah:

> In the future, we're all working for small companies. Does that mean that everyone has to work harder? 'Cause people at startups work a lot harder than people at big companies (on average).

Naval:

> Yea, but when you're working it your way, there's less bullshit (hopefully). When you're doing it your own way, it doesn't feel like work.

I couldn't have said it better myself.
