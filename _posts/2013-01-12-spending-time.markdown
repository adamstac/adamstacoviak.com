There's a reason why time is often referred to as _spent_.





You might hear yourself, or someone say something like this.





> 
  
> 
> "Hey let's spend some time together next week when I'm in town."
> 
> 






...or





> 
  
> 
> "I spent my Christmas at my parent's house this year. I love spending time with the family for the holidays."
> 
> 






...or





> 
  
> 
> "I wish we had more time to spend together. I can't believe it's over."
>

Everyday, every human-being on Earth is constantly spending their time. No matter who you are, or what you're doing, _you're always spending time_. Everyone's time is limited, and none of us know exactly how much time we have to spend. We do know that once your time is gone, and there's no more left to spend, that's it. It's gone.





Take a minute, or should I say _spend a minute_, to pause and truly reflect on that truth for a moment. Be silent, and be still. Think about all the ways you spend your time. Knowing that your time is limited, and that once it's gone there's no more â€” is there anything you'd change about how you're spending your time? What are you spending your time on? Where are you spending your time? How are you spending your time? _With whom are you spending your time?_





Time is precious. Once it's gone, it's gone. _Spend wisely._
