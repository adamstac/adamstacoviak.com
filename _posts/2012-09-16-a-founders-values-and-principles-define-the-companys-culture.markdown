Where does a company's culture come from?

Rui Rodrigues:

> What the founders actually do on a daily basis, what their core values are, what attitudes guide them will in the end have more influence in the company’s culture than a set of guidelines written on the wall. Whatever the principles that you agree on, a company’s culture is defined over the simplest interactions that happen among all those involved with the company.

If you lead, they will follow and the values you represent will trickle down into the life blood of your business.
