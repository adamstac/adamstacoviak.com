[Joseph Campbell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Campbell) in [Reflections in the Art of Living: A Joseph Campbell Companion](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060926171?ie=UTF8&camp=213733&creative=393185&creativeASIN=0060926171&linkCode=shr&tag=adamstaccom-20):

> If you follow your bliss, you put yourself on a kind of track that has been there all the while, waiting for you, and the life that you ought to be living is the one you are living. When you can see that, you begin to meet people who are in your field of bliss, and they open doors to you. I say, follow your bliss and don't be afraid, and doors will open where you didn't know they were going to be.

Powerful words.
