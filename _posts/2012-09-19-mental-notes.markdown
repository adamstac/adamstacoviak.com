It's tough to remember all the ways to apply psychology into the design of our applications. If you've ever caught yourself saying, "oh let me make a 'mental note' of that," you'll love Stephen Anderson's [Mental Notes](http://getmentalnotes.com/).

> In the midst of a busy project it's all too easy to forget the nuances that distinguish great products. Mental Notes brings together 50 insights from psychology into an easy reference and brainstorming tool. Each card describes one insight into human behavior and suggests ways to apply this to the design of Web sites, Web apps, and software applications.
