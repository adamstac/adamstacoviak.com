![The Web 2.0 Show](http://adamstacoviak.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/web20show.png)





It's official ... [The Web 2.0 Show](http://web20show.com/) is retired.





But there's no reason to be sad. I started a new podcast called [Founders Talk](http://5by5.tv/founderstalk) on [Dan Benjamin's](http://danbenjamin.com/) internet broadcast network [5by5](http://5by5.tv/).





For most, the news of me starting Founders Talk on 5by5 is kinda old news (It was started October 2010). As for The Web 2.0 Show, in all honesty that show has been retired for quite a while now. I just haven't been the best steward of this blog or the show's site to let folks know. The last show was produced in April 2010 and featured [Neil Patel of KISSmetrics](http://web20show.com/2010/04/episode-74-neil-patel/).





So, what's going to happen to the show's website and archives?





Nothing. The show's [website](http://web20show.com/) and [archives](http://web20show.buzzsprout.com/) will remain online and freely accessible forever.





The Web 2.0 Show came online in 2005 and produced over 75 episodes with guests like:







  * [Andrew Mason of Groupon.com](http://web20show.com/2009/11/episode-59-andrew-mason-and-groupon-com/)


  * [Mike McDerment of Freshbooks](http://web20show.com/2010/01/episode-66-mike-mcderment/)


  * [Eric Ries of Startup Lessons Learned](http://web20show.com/2010/03/episode-72-the-lean-startup-eric-ries/)


  * [Plus many, many more...](http://web20show.com/archives/)





## Founders Talk is launched





[![Founders Talk](http://adamstacoviak.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/founderstalk-large.jpeg)](http://5by5.tv/founderstalk)





[Founders Talk](http://5by5.tv/founderstalk) has been an idea I've had for a while, and to me it sums up what I love most about The Web 2.0 Show - conversations with founders about their stories, the up and downs, lessons learned and everything in between. So I extracted that out of The Web 2.0 Show, and pulled that into Founders Talk.





I also didn't want Founders Talk to be too niche and "uber geek" focused. Not that that's a bad thing, I mean that's part of my DNA - I just wanted to cast a wider net. If that's your thing, then listen to [The Changelog](http://thechangelog.com/) (another podcast I produce) for a more tech focused podcast and blog. Founders Talk focuses less on the technologies being used and more on the story of the founders and how things got started. Sure, technology is still brought up, but the focus of the conversation is on their story, history, fails, successes, lessons learned, advice, etc. I also knew that there would come a day when the term "Web 2.0" would no longer hold its value and would ultimately reflect poorly on the topics and content of the podcast.





I want to thank all of you who have listened to my podcasts and supported me over the years. I appreciate you.
