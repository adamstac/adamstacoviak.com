[Danny Meyer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Meyer):

> It's my job, and consequently the job of every other leader in my company, to teach everyone who works for us to distinguish center from off center and always to set things right. I send my managers an unequivocal message: I'm going to be extremely specific as to where every component on that tabletop belongs. I anticipate that outside forces, including you, will conspire to change the table setting. Every time that happens, I'm going to move everything back to the way it should be. _That's the constant aspect._ I'll never recenter the saltshaker in a way that denies you your dignity. _That's the gentle aspect._ But standards are standards, and I'm constantly watching every table and pushing back on every saltshaker that's moved because excellent performance is paramount. _That's the pressure._

It's a fantastic read for those who are leaders, or aspire to lead.
