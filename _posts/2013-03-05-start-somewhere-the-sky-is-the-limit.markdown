[![Sam Walton's 5-10 (five-and-dime)](http://distilleryimage7.s3.amazonaws.com/1e96d6ce84fb11e2ad6922000a1fa410_7.jpg)](http://instagram.com/p/Wci53vohl7/)





[This is a picture](http://instagram.com/p/Wci53vohl7/) of Sam Walton's very first Walton's 5-10 (five-and-dime).





I'm visiting [Pure Charity's](https://purecharity.com/) HQ in Bentonville, AR, also the worldwide headquarters of [Walmart](http://corporate.walmart.com/our-story/), which for the most part is a small town "in the middle of nowhere," Arkansas.





_This is **literally** where it all began._





Whatever you do, _start somewhere_!
