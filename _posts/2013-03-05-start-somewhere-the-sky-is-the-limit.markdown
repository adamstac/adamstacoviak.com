This is a picture I took of the very first Five and Dime Sam Walton created. This is **literally** where Walmart began.

I'm visiting [Pure Charity's](https://purecharity.com/) HQ in Bentonville, AR, also the worldwide headquarters of [Walmart](http://corporate.walmart.com/our-story/), which for the most part is a small town "in the middle of nowhere," Arkansas.

Whatever you do, start somewhere!
