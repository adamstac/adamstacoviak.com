With the Squarespace Developer Platform, we have taken a significant step to bridge these worlds together, eliminating the need for a shared web host for the most demanding website designs.

I have to say that I'm rather hopeful for where this is going. Having Git in the mix certainly makes things interesting, but their choice of [LESS](http://lesscss.org/) over [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) is upsetting. Y'all know I'm a huge advocate for Sass.





The Squarespace developer platform is free to develop on, but once you're ready to go live, an unlimited Squarespace package ($16/month) is required to use the developer features. Total cost for a squarespace site with developer features is $192 per year ($16 * $12 = $192).
