This is EXACTLY why I've stuck with my iPad 3. _I'm absolutely spoiled by its retina display._ That's actually the reason I bought it in the first place. My main function on my iPad is reading. If I'm not reading/tweeting with Tweetbot, I'm reading a book with Kindle or reading articles in Readability.





Plus, as Joshua said in his post, the size and weight of an iPad mini hasn't had a chance to taint my feelings for its larger iPad 3 counterpart yet.





Waiting for retina.
