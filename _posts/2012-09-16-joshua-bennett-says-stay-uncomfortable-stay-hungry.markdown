Joshua makes some very good points on contentment and how that effects your drive and hunger.





Joshua:

If you are content; you become stagnant, less aggressive, and make careless mistakes. He closes with "Stay unsettled. Keep it uncomfortable," which reminds me of ["Stay hungry. Stay foolish."](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/post/steve-jobs-told-students-stay-hungry-stay-foolish/2011/10/05/gIQA1qVjOL_blog.html) from the late Steve Jobs.
