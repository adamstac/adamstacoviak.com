> Flows are just as important to good interfaces as individual screens are. Customers donâ€™t land on screens from out of nowhere. Specific sequences of actions lead customers through your app as they try to accomplish their tasks.

Before I start wireframing or designing screens, I start by fleshing out the flows the user can take to complete the task or job I'm designing. Since reading this post from Ryan Singer, I now use his simple shorthand method to create my user flows.
