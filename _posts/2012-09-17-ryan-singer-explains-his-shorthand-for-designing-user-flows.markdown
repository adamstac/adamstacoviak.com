Before I start wireframing or designing screens, I start by fleshing out the flows the user can take to complete the task or job I'm designing.  Since reading this post by [Ryan Singer](http://feltpresence.com/), I now use his simple shorthand method on paper and OmniGraffle to create my flows. This shorthand method not only saves time, but also keeps things simple.
