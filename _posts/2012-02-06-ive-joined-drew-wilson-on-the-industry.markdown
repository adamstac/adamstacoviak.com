I've joined forces with [Drew Wilson](https://twitter.com/#!/drewwilson) and [Jared Erondu](https://twitter.com/#!/jarederondu) on The Industry. If you haven't heard of [The Industry](http://theindustry.cc/), now would be a good time to [check it out](http://theindustry.cc/2011/12/12/welcome-to-the-industry/).





I'll be heading up The Industry podcast as well as some biz dev and partnership opportunities. [Get in touch](mailto:general@theindustry.cc) if you'd like to work with us. Subscribe to the podcast on [iTunes](http://itun.es/iSp69n), [Instacast](http://vemedio.com/products/instacast) and via [RSS](http://feeds.feedburner.com/theindustryradio). We're also a live show that broadcasts weekly on Thursday's at 3pm PDT / 6pm EDT - [tune in here](http://theindustry.cc/live).
