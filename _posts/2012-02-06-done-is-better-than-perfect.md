Giovanni Collazo's [tribute to "the hacker way"](http://elweb.co/hacking/how-our-tribute-to-the-hacker-way-pissed-off-a-facebook-designer/) [upset Ben Barry](https://twitter.com/#!/benbarry/status/165250329947021314), the a Facebook designer who started the [Facebook Analog Research Laboratory](https://www.facebook.com/analoglab), and also the origianl creator of the now infamous [Facebook Propaganda posters](http://benbarry.com/project/facebook-propaganda-posters)).

Ultimatley the drama died down, and Ben decided to [release the Facebook posters](http://benbarry.com/project/facebook-propaganda-posters) under a Creative Commons license.
