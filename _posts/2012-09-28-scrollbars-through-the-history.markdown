[![Scrollbars Through the History](http://adamstacoviak.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/jpdGk.png)](http://adamstacoviak.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/jpdGk.png)





The history of scrollbars seems like a natural progression to me. Although, when Apple revealed the scrollbar only during user interaction on the iPhone in 2007, and then adopted that pattern in [OS X Lion](https://developer.apple.com/technologies/mac/lion.html) with what they termed "Overlay Scrollbars" - that was a significant turning point for the scrollbar UI/UX.
