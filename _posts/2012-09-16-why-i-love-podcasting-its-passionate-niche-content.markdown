Richard MacManus shares his thoughts on why he loves podcasting.





I agree that there are tons of new podcasts on the scene, in whatever scene you are in. Podcasting is, in fact, exploding! _My only concern_ is podcasting is a lot of work and unless you're a full time podcaster, getting advertisers to support your show can be a full time job. Getting paid can be a chore in and of itself on top of the work required to produce a quality show.
