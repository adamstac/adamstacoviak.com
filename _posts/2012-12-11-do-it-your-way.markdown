In [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIXx617xVMo&list=PLG7JvYPJw5oOH0Xbtfs_6BLjVE61fkPNa) with [AngelList](https://angel.co/) founder [Naval Ravikant](https://twitter.com/naval), [Sarah Lacy](http://pandodaily.com/author/pandosarahlacy/) asks him about the one thing he believes in that no one else does.





Sarah:

Naval:

> Yea, but when you're working it your way, there's less bullshit (hopefully). When you're doing it your own way, it doesn't feel like work.
