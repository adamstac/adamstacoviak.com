I started out in podcasting at the very end of 2006. As I write that year, it seems so long ago -- and it was. Podcasting was new. It was a proving ground. Any decent show on a topic that has a following was a hit. That's my opinion atleast on that time for podcasting -- especially podcasting on technical topics. Twitter didn't exist. Subscribing to a show wasn't easy. Not that many people were doing it.

What I never expected, was that I'd find myself through podcasting.

The following is my story on how I got started with podcasting, and how it has shaped who I am today.
