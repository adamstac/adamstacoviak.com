It doesn't matter if your "forgot password" link is clearly visible. That fact is irrelevant. What matters is how you react to show how human you are and how you make a connection that changes how that person feels about you and the solution you aim to provide.





Don't let _pride_ stop you from providing a _delightful_ experience.
