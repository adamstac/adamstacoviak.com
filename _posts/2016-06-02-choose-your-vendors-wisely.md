This isn't a post I wanted to write. But time and time again, I've been burned by people I've trusted to help me build my business.

I come out of the game with excitement of the dreams fullfilled to come.

> Let’s do it! We’re excited about working together, and we feel that you and the work we’ll do together will play a critical role in our future.

Let me tell you. What I dreamed on that day is not a relaity today. We're nearly 6 months down the road from that day, and we have very little to show for the time inbetween. In fact, if we didn't call that final meeting to share our complete disappointment, I believe we'd still be waiting.

So where did things go wrong?
