> Bourbon Neat—or Neat for short—is a lightweight, open source fluid grid framework built on top of Sass and Bourbon with an emphasis on flexibility and ease of use. The framework comes with sensible defaults and useful mixins to help get both developers and designers up and running in minutes.

The CSS grid framework pool just got a bit bigger. This time the new contender is from [Thoughtbot](http://thoughtbot.com/), the popular Ruby on Rails shop out of Boston. Neat relies entirely on Sass mixins and doesn't pollute your HTML with presentation classes or extra wrapping div's. Of course, it's responsive.





For those that use [Compass](http://compass-style.org/), get sad. _[Neat](http://thoughtbot.com/neat/) is best served with [Bourbon](http://thoughtbot.com/bourbon/)_.
