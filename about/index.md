This is my humble little blog. It is a place for me to share my thoughts on the web, podcasting, insights, links and more. Because I'm reluctant to share too much of my private personal life with the public, this blog will mostly contain my personal perspective on my professional life.

I lead product at [Pure Charity](https://www.purecharity.com/), I run [RIZN Media](http://riznmedia.com/) where I produce a few podcasts. Hopefully you're a listener.

## Faith

I am a disciple of Jesus Christ. I don't have a denomination. I don't have a religion. I am simply attempting to follow the relational God of the Bible, a flesh and blood, Middle-Eastern carpenter named Jesus. This is the first thing on my list when describing who I am because Jesus and His teachings are the foundation, <a href="http://www.youversion.com/bible/verse/niv/luke/6/48" title="Build Your House on the Rock" target="_blank">the Rock</a>, on which I build everything.

Don't get me wrong. Like the tax collector in <a href="http://bible.us/Luke18.13.ESV" title="God, be merciful to me, a sinner!" target="_blank">Luke 18:13</a>, I am a sinner and God isn't done with me yet. So, if you think that I lead with my passion and pursuit of our Lord Jesus Christ as a means to tell you that I am perfect, or that I think I'm better than you in some way ... I'm not.

<h2>Podcasting</h2>

One of my favorite hobbies is podcasting. Like many hobbies, my passion for podcasting has led me to turn more "professional", and I have been able to establish myself in a few serious roles. I produce and host <a href="http://5by5.tv/founderstalk" title="Founders Talk" target="_blank">Founders Talk</a> on <a href="http://5by5.tv/" title="5by5 - Internet Broadcasting" target="_blank">5by5</a>. I produce and co-host <a href="http://thechangelog.com/" title="The Changelog" target="_blank">The Changelog</a> which also happens to be a fairly popular blog as well that covers what's fresh and new in open source software. I also produce and host <a href="http://theindustry.cc/" title="The Industry" target="_blank">The Industry Radio Show</a> with Drew Wilson and Jared Erondu.
